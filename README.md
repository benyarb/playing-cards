# [Playing Cards](http://benyarbrough.com/playing-cards/)

This is a CoffeeScript implementation of a card deck with shuffle and deal functionality. The main file of interest is the CoffeeScript file ([script.coffee](https://github.com/benyarb/playing-cards/blob/master/scripts/coffee/script.coffee)) where most of the functionality lives. Other files of interest:
* [HTML](https://github.com/benyarb/playing-cards/blob/master/index.html)
* [Style](https://github.com/benyarb/playing-cards/blob/master/styles/less/main.less)
