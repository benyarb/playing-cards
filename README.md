# [Playing Cards](http://benyarbrough.com/playing-cards/)

This is a CoffeeScript implementation of a card deck with shuffle and deal functionality. The main file of interest is the CoffeeScript file ([script.coffee](https://github.com/benyarb/playing-cards/blob/master/scripts/coffee/script.coffee)) where most of the functionality lives. The [HTML](https://github.com/benyarb/playing-cards/blob/master/index.html) and [Styles](https://github.com/benyarb/playing-cards/blob/master/styles/less/main.less) are worth checking out, as well.

This project was built in these languages:
* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)
* [Less](http://lesscss.org/)

It makes use of several frameworks and components, including:
* [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
* [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/)
